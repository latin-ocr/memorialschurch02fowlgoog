brig. ed. Hearne, vol. 111. p. 782 ; 0110118ο 1719.) There ¹are
entries to the same effect in Hearne's Collections (Doble, vol. i.
pp. 298, 315¹). By his will dated October 12, 1706, and written
in the same style as the epitaph, he gave 101. 101 the encourage-
ment 01 the choir in Ripon, to be distributed to the vicars,
the organist, the singing men and boys, and the two Church
01110010, by his dear friend Mr. Dean (Wyvill) in such propor-
tions 00 he should think fit.

Mr. Penton, according 10 Wood, was the author 01 ‘ A Dis-
course concerning the Worship of God towards the Holy Table
01 111101,’2 ‘Apparatus ad Theologiam' (dedicated to the Earl 01
Ailesbury), and 01 1110 01 three other works, which 010 011111110-
rated in the Athenae 011011, and which confirm the remark of
Hearne, that he was ‘of a most facetions Temper.’

His will is so characteristic and interesting that we give it
in full from Reg. Test. Ebor. lxiii. 240.
