and took heed to the thing that was right, it was but their
duty as Christians or as clerks, and, this being regarded as
matter of course, finds no place, as a rule, in the Archbishops'
registers. It was when they got into trouble on account of
evil-doing or negligenee in duty that such proceedings as are
here recorded became necessary, and were registered. Accord-
ingly, we find abundant illustration of the evils arising from
y such abuses as papal provisione, whereby Italian ecclesiastica,
real or pretended, held prebends in Ripon; pluralities and con-
sequent non-residence‚ still more fully illustrated in the Farfi3

clerkly recreatione of principale, etc-things which went on
until all wise and good men felt that a vigorous reformation of

to have taken it solely as a safeguard against being tried in
the secular courts for any offences they might feel disposed to

other provisions for the enlargement and repaire of the fabric
of the ehurch. Some minor matters of interest will also be

churches defiled by blood, the prohibitions against marketing
in chureh and lay folk standing in the choir, a complaint
from a preaching friar that one of the vicars had maliciously
and rashly hindered him in his work, and finally how some
‘sons of Belial’ broke into the Archbishop’s gaol with axes,
chisels, hammerS, and other instruments of iron and wood‚ and

let loose the prisoners. Ar p. 72 will be found proceedings
against a Ripon chaplain who was reputed to be the inventor
of apestiferous game called Dprrqetlrrystes, and called himself
