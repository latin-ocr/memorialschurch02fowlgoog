Scilicet orba suo turba Favore jacet.

En Pastor medicusque obiit, J urisque peritusr
I, sequere in coelos, qui modo salvus eris.’

He is buried in the chancel, and on the gravestone, now

Qui quidem extremam fidus permansit ad horam,

Theologus medicusque obiit, J urisque peritus3

Sed bona gens, populus sanctus, pietatis et ardens,
