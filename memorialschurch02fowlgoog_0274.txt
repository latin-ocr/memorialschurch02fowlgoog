RECONSTITUTION OT THE CHAPTER.

clerical body, who are scarcely known to us except by the com·
paratively few names which have survived. Some will be found
in the pages 01 the Chapter Acts, more in these volumes, in
the indices of which the office of each person i's indicated. The
dissolution took place in the first year 01 Edward VI, 1547-8.

As late as the 36th Hen. VIII, some years after the dis-
solution 01 the neighbouring monasterieS, a commission was
granted by the king empowering the archbishops of York 101
the time being to visit the church 01 Ripon, to reform in it what
should be found amiss, and to collate to each of the prebende
from time to time, as they should become vacant, a successor, '
10 be selected from three clerks to be recommended by the
chapter. The archbishops were also authorised by the same
commission to dispose 0f the government of the hospitals of
St. John the Baptist and St. Mary Magdalene, in and near
Ripon, and to have the appointment of the masters. ’

After the dissolution, as above mentioned, the revenues 01
the church and chantries were seized upon hythe Crown and
added to the possessions of the Duchy of Lancaster. Out of
them a very small annual stipend was allowed for the main·
tenance of one or more ministers to carry on the parochial
duties of the town and the service 01 the church.

The ecclesiastical affairs of Ripon continued in this de·
plorable state 101 more than half a century, although attempta
were made in the meantime by persons in high authority to
remedy the evil. In Queen Elizabeth’s reign Archbishop Sandys,
the Earl of Huntingdon, Lords Burleigh and Sheffield, Alexander
Nowell, Dean 01 St. Paul's, the celebrated Hooker, and Moses
Fowler, one 01 the parish ministers and afterwards Dean 01
Ripon, interested themselves with the queen to increase the
endowment of the church and to establish a college under its
protection for the education of young persons intended 101 the
ministry3 but the scheme was opposed by the Lord Treasurer
Buckhurst, and fell 10 the ground.

Early in the reign of J ames I. the design was again brought
forward, and the parishioners petitioned the Queen Consort‚
Anne of Denmark, for the establishment of an ecclesiastical
college; and though in this respect they were again doomed to
disappointment, she influenced the king with effect for the re·
establishment of the collegiate church.

Accordingly, on August 2, in the second year 01 his
reign, 11). 1604, the king constituted the late dissolved church
