‘the master and abbot 01 that order'; 110 was also charged
with other 01100000, and handed over 101 0011001100 101110 Arch-
deacon 01 Richmond, within whose jurisdiction, at Aysgarth, he
was then living. In the levies, etc, that were made in times
01 war with Scotland, Ripon is brought into touch with the
general history 01 the country. ’

Such are some 01 the principal subjectmatters 01 the
extracts, and, as above intimated, some readers, who may not
have time or inclination 10 gc through the whole 011110 original
matter, may find it worth while 01 1000110 look through the
side-notes and index.

The Festa· Ripouieaaes, forming the second portion 01 the
volume, were originally compiled, as is stated on p. 183, by
Mr. Ward. Ι1 was intended that these collectione should form
a Surtees volume 101 1861, but owing to his death, which

Ward’s family have again placed his MSS. at the disposal of

have been made 10 them from the York registers and other

persons, otherwise than in continuation 01 0 work like the 1111011.
We could hardly have stcpped short 01 the Cathedral establish-
ment; and, having mentioned that, it seemed undesirable to
stop short 01 making the work complete up 101110 time 01
publication.

1110 hoped that a third and concluding volume 01 these
‘Mammida' containing the very interesting account rolls and
other things which have been too long promised, will appear at
no very distant date, the materiale having long been all but
ready 101 1110 press, and only delayed by its having been thought
better to issue'the Registers and roste· previously&
