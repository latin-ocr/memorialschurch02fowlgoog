daughter of his younger brother, John Wilkinson‚ and wife of
the Rev. Marmaduke Lawson, prebendary of Ripon and rector
of Sproatley. A monument tc the memory of Mr. Wilkinson
and his brother Andrew was created in Aldborough Church‚

West and North Ridings of Yorkshire3 whose life has been
pre-eminently distinguished by unaffected piety, inflexible
integrity and unwearied zeal in the service of the public, during
a period of halfa century. He dred the 18²¹& of January, 1805,
aged 74 years? The bust of the deceased forming part of this
monument is said to be a striking resemblance of Mr. Wilkin-
son, and it is valuable as being one of the first sculptures in
marble executed by the celebrated Chantrey‚ who was a native
of Nortcn in the neighbourhood.¹ Mr. Wilkinson published
only one sermon, preached on the opening of the Sheffield ·
Infirmary in 1797. He purchased of the Duke of Norfolk the
two thirds of the small tithes of Sheffield, which had originally
belonged to the Carthusian monastery at (loventry‚ but had, at
the dissolution of that house, been granted to the Countess of
Northumberland‚ and had, through the Earls of Shrewsbury,
descended tc the Dukes of Ncrfolh. He annexed them to the
viearage, charged with a payment of lot. per annum to the
Sheffield Infirmary for ever.
