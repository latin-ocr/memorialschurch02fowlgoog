the temporalities ou September 4. He was consecrated on J anu-
ary 9 following. He was created patriarch 01 Jerusalem by Pope
Clement V, May 4, 1305. He founded 0 collegiata chapel at
Auckland Gastle dedicated 10 St. Andrew, and to the dean and
Ἴ twelve prebendaries officiating there he appropriated the church
01 Morpeth, but after his death the patronage 01 this rectory was
recovered by William de Greystock. He built considerable por-

turned into a chapel. At Lanchester and at Chester-le-Street
he built and endowed acollege in each 101 0 dean and seven pre-

He also had leave to castellate his mansion at Somerton‚ 00.
Lincoln (Rot. Pat. 9 Edw. I.) and the maner house at‘Eltham
in Kent, which last he bequeathed to the king, and it became
0110 01 the royal palaces. Bishop Beck died at Eltham, March
3, 1310-11, and was buried in the chapel 01 the Nine Altars at
Durham, being the first bishop interred within the cathedral
since St Cuthbert.

He held several civil udices, having been appointed

procured the dignity 01 King 01 the Isle 01 Μο11 from Edward II.
As a military chief, commonly known as ‘the fighting bishop,’
his power and grandeur were most conspicuous. On some oc-
casions he attended the king in his wars, with a thousand 1001 .
soldiers, five hundred horse, and 0110 hundred and fifty knights,
esquires, aud standard-hearers, marching under the consecrated
banner 01 St. Cuthbert.. Notwithstanding his munificence 110
died very rich. (Mr. Ward has not given his authorities, buthe
doubtless derived his information 11010 the usual sources. On
Beck's life as bishop 01 Durham see Hist. Dunelm. Scriptores
Tres, pp. 63-91, and Godwin, Surtees,Newcourt, and Hutchin-
son, and Diocesan History 01 Durham, S.P.O.K.‚ pp. 165-176.)
