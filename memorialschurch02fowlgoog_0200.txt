FASTI RIPONIENSES.

-000-·-

ΤΗΕ little that is known of the rasa· of the Churoh of Ripon
from the middle of the seventh century to the. latter part of
the thirteenth, when the York Registers begin to give us defi-
nite information, is to be found in the earlier portion of Vol. Ι.
The following notes collected by the late Rev. John Ward,
M.A.‚ Rector of Wath, near Ripon‚ about twenty-six years ago,
fall into three main divisione, viz. the ‘Old’ or Mediaeval

foundation, probably dating from about the time of the Nor·

man Conquest‚ p. 1823 King James's foundation of 16043 and
the ‘Now’ foundation, dating from the earliest years of the
present reign. They are now printed, with many additions and

correctione, as an important contribution to these Memorials.
