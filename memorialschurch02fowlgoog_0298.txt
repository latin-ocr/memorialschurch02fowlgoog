Christ Ohurch in Dublin by patent, dated August 30, 1633, and
was installed September 3. 111 the year 1634 he voided all his
English preferments on being appointed by patent, dated
May 24, 10 the see 01 Derry. He was consecrated on the 26111
in the chapel of Dublin Castle by Archbishop Ussher and the
Bishops of Meath, Down, and Oork. While here he exerted
himself with energy and success in recovering some 01 the
property which had been improperly taken away from his clergy '
and from the see. And perhaps it was partly on this account
that he was 00 greatly plundered and ill-used at the time 01 the
rebellion in 1641, that he retired 10 England and afterwards 10
the Continent. Upon the Restoration he was translated to the
archbishopric 01 Armagh and the primacy 01 011 Ireland ,101111-

destructive pestilence, visiting them in their houseS, baptising
their children, and doing all other offices 01 his ministry.
Here, 100, he preached constantly for several years, and became
so eminent, not only 101 his abilities in the pulpit, but also
for his knowledge 01 the laws, that he was frequently chosen
arbitrator between contending parties3 and by that and his
good behaviour in all other respects‚ obtained so much honour
and interest that there was scarcely any publio transaction over
which he had not considerable influence. There 010 several
lives 01 the archbishop, particularly that by Bishop Vesey, with
a collection of his worlrs, published in 1678. His 1110 and
works were published in 1842 01 Oxford, forming a portion of
the Library of Anglo-Catholie Theology. The Rawdon papers,
