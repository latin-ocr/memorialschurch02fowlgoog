207

Stanley, third surviving son of Thomna, first Earl of Derby‚by his Ἴ

wife Eleanor, daughter of Richard N eville, Earl of Salisbury, and ’

sister of Richard the great Earl of Warwick, was born in Lanca·
shire, and educated first at Oxford and afterwards at Cambridge,
where-he graduated. Oxford, however, granted him the degree
of Doctor of Decrees January 29, 1506-7, with the usual cere·
mony of a cap being placed on his head in London, by William,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard, Bishop of London. He

became Warden of Manchester, July 22, 1485, on the death of “

James Stanley, his uncle.l He also held the prebend of Dun-
ham in Southwell3 this he resigned in 1484-5, in which year,
on March 20, he was appointed precentor in Salisbury Cathe-
dral, but was not collated until September 10, 1505, and
vacated the office in the following year. In February 1470-71,
he was appointed to the mastership of the hospital at Brackley
dedicated to St. James and St. John. He was the last master,
and probably held the office until 1484, when Francis, Viscount
Lovell of Tichmarsh, granted the advowson of this house to
William (Waynflete), Bishop of Winchester, in trust for the
President and Fellows of St. Mary Magdalene College, Oxford, in
fee for ever. (Baker's N orthantS, i. 581.) In 1491 he was in-
stalled prebendary of Yatminster prima in Salisbury, which he
erchanged the next year for Beaminster prima, in the same
church. He was admitted in 1493 to the deanery of* St.
Martin-le-Grand, of which he was the last independent dean,
the advowson and possessione of that foundation having been
granted by Henry VH, for the endowment of his new chapel at
Westminster, to Abbot Islip and his successors, who thence-
forward assumed the jurisdiction of this ancient Royal Chapel,
and discharged its duties by vicars of their appointment.
Stanley was chosen archdeacon of Richmond November 19,
1500, and admitted December 5. He was appointed to the
see of Ely by bull of Pope Julius IL, and the temporalities were
restored to him November 5, 1506. He died at Manchester,
March 22, 1514-15, and was buried in an unfinished chapel
that he was theu building on the north side of the choir of the
collegiate church there. This building, called the Ely Chapel‚
was subsequently completed‚ and within it was placed a tomb
to his memory, with a small brasS, and the following inscrip-

tion 2-1‘ Off yur charite pray for the soule of James Stanley,

(1) There appears to be some confusion between the uncle and the
nephew in Newcourt’s and other worlrs.
