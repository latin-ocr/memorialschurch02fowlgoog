and took heed to the thing that was right, it was but their
duty as Christiana or as clerks, and, this being regarded as
matter of course, finds no place, as a rute, in the Archbishops’
registers. It was when they got into trouble on account of
evil-doing or negligenoe in duty that such proceedings as are

here recorded became necessary, and were registered. Accord-
ingly, we find abundant illustration of the evils arising from
y such abuses as papal provisions, whereby Italian ecclesiastios,
real or pretended, held prebends in Ripon; pluralities and con·
sequent non-residence‚ still more fully illustrated in the Facti3

from a preaching friat that one of the vicars had maliciously
and rushly hindered him in his work, and finally how some
‘sons of Belial’ broke into the Archbishop’s gaol with axeS,
chisels‚ hommem, und other iustruments of iron and wood, and
let loose the prisoners. At p. 72 vill be found proceedings
against a llipon chapluin who was reputed to be the inventor
