The Dean and these Prehendaries held a Chapter June 6,
1640, which is all the authoritythat I have for making the
latter 01 1110111 the particular persons who suffered at the Dis-
solution of the Oollege. Whether there are any Chaplains
belonging 10 11 01 1101, Ι cannot say. The Prehendaries were all
01 them heneficed also, but how any 01 them fared except Dr.
Marsh, at their several Livings, Ι know not. This Collega was
dissolved in those dismal times3 all the members of it were
turned out, all the lands and revenues, which belonged to the
Dean and Chapter, were sold, and one, who called himself Dr.
Richardson, was appointed to preach in the Minster by the
Parliament, tho' in all probability he was never in any
Orders‚ Presbyt terian or Episcopal On the Restoration he went
10 Hol land and practised Physio 11101ος and though he thus
gave way to the right owners ,yet heis, by the Abridgement,
rechoned as ejected?

Three years afterwards, however, Dr. Richardson was deeply

implicated rn the Yorkshire conspiracy for overturning the ι

existing Government, commonly called ‘The Fameley Wood
Plot,' from the circumstance of the conspirators having met there

in force cn October 12, 1663,101 the purpose 01 advancing on '

Leeds and Yorlr. Their number was smaller than was expected,
and the next morning they retired, on an alarm being given
that the King's troops were approaching. Some were afterwards
made prisonem, but the greater part of the plotters, and
probably Dr. Richardson among them, took refuge in foreign
countries (Whittaker, Loidis 01 Elmete, p. 106).

In the south aisle of the choir at Ripon is a defaced tablet
commemorating the death 01 DorcaS, wife to this Dr. Richard-

(1) He was buried at Malpas Feb. 10, 1647-8.
