died in 1401, and is buried 11 Balsham under a grey marble
slab lying in the midst 01 the chancel, with one of the finest
>brasses in Eugland (Lysons' Mag. Brit. vol. ii. part 1, p. 663
Haiues’ Mon. Brasses, vol. ii. p. 31). The inscription is as follows,
the contractione 01 the original being extended. It gives some
additional particulare 01 his official positione :—

›1⁴Jon Sleford dictus rector mundoque relictus,
Bursa non 11110101, jacet 1110 sub marmore pictus,
Fautor justorum constans ultor viciorum,

Quem Rex Edwardus dilexerat, ad mala tardus,
Garderobam rexit illiue, dum bene vixit,
Ecclesiam struxit hanc, nunquam postea luxit,
Haec fecit stalla, large fundensque catalla,
Canonicus primo Wellys, Ryppon 11111110,1
Edwardi festo decessit fine modesto, -

Regis et Anglorum qui detulit acta reorum,²
Anno Milleno quadringeno quoque pleno,

Huic addens primum, deductum corpus ad imum.
Ο clemens Christe, coelos precor intret ut iste, ’
Nil habeat triste, quia protulit omnibus iste.

Mn. 0111111111001101,11111.,001111011. (Reg. Scrope, 4 0.)
Ηο was 1 younger son 01 Stephen‚ Lord Scrope 01 Μ11111111 and
Upsal, by Margaret, daughter 01 John, Lord Welles. Between
March 21, 1395-6, and the end of 1400, he held succes·
sively the prebends 01 ι011101, Colwich and Demford in
1101111111, which last he resigned in the same year. Previously
10 his obtaining Driffield, 111 held for a very short period the
prebende 01 Langtoft and Knarcsborough in York. He was
appointed 10 Driffield, March 9, 1400-1, and resigned it in
1401-2. Η1 was collated by Archbishop Scrope, May 19,1400‚
Ι10 the archdeaconry 01 Richmond, and installed by proxy on
the 22nd3 but Nicholas Bubbewyth, a clerk in chancery, was
appointed by papal provisicn, installed by proxy March 16,
1401-2, and confirmed hythe king. Two days afterwards he
exchanged it 101 the prebend 01 Driffield with his predecessor,
Stephen le Scrope, who was again admitted 10 the archdeaconry,

(1) Blomefield suggests that as Le Neve mentions one John Rippon 10 beve
been Archdcacon 01 Welle in 1390, he may be the same man, for it was
then usual for the clergy 10 take names from their preferments, as Henry of
Huntingdon did, from being archdeacon of that place.

(2) These words seem to refer 10 some law office under the Grown.
