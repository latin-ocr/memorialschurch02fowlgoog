Paunnnnsulns OF THIl SECOND STALL.

Templo Londin. Erat ille acerrimus propugnator Religionis
Reformatac, quarn filius ejus Ric. Crashaw injuriis 0010600,
pressus inopia, Patria extorris, et complexu Matris Ecclesiae
avulsus, abjuravit. Recensetur ille inte'r Benefactores Collegii
06 Bibliothecae, nullos tamen libros dedisse comperio. Libri
fere omnes ejus nomine inscripti, donati erant a Com.
Southampt., ab aliis nonnulli. Certe si dedisset aliquos,
dedisset suos (a se scriptos). Non 10016. Animus tamen non
defuit, sed facultas, obiit enim (ut videtur) non admodum
opulentus, relictis libris et liberis. Filius ejus,'tam Pictor
quam Poeta, reliquit nobis quaedam artis suae monumenta?
(Baker’s MS. in St. Joh. Coll. Camb.) Thomas Wriothesley,
Earl of Southanrpton, KG, who was High Steward 01 the
university from 1642 60 1667, purchased the Crashaw Library,
consisting 01 about 162 MSS. and 2,000 printed volumes, 01
Richard Crashaw the poet. From Parr’s Usshcr's Letters it
seems that William Crashaw was suspected by some 01 the
bishops in 1610, and from the same source we leam that he
was employed to revise Mr. Justice Sibthorp's book. Mr.
Crashaw was curate of Beverlcy minster from 1599 to 1605.
In 1600 Arehbishop Hutton collated him 60 the vicarage of
Burton AgneS, upon which the heirs 01 660 Earl 01 Derby
brought 0. quare impedit, and judgment was given against
Crashaw; but he was afterwards reinstated. He was collated
to the prebend 01 Osbaldwick in York April 2, 1617, and 16
became vacant in 1626. Α1106 01 his works is in Watt’s
Bibliotheca Britannico.
