Minurovrr 8010101, a monk of Fountains, held this
prebend and was resident in 15353 he was also master of the
hospital of St. Mary Magdalene. The Act of 1534 constituted
Hull a suffragan See, and Dugdale calls Bradley suffragan of ·
Hull. He was also the last abbot of Fountains, put in as a
willing instrument to its dissolution. He received a pension
of lOOl. per annum asa reward for his compliance. It would
appear from the Oamden Sooiety’s volume of letters relating 1ο
the suppression of monasterias (vol. xxvi. p. 100), that Bradley
had held a prebend in Ripon for twenty years at the time he
was recommended 10 the abbacy, namely January 20, 1535-6;
but at that date only thirteen years had elapsed from Hugh
Assheton’s decease. He was cited with other canons by Arch-
bishop Lee, in 1538, on account cf the state of the fabric (above,
p. 179). In 1544, 1545, and 1546, he was sole residentiary(Ch.
Acte, 348-3523 vol. i. p. 304). Ηο died April 11,1553‚and
was buried at Ripon, as appears in a paper book, Ripon Chapter
