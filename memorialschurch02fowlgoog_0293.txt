MEMORIALS OF RIPON.

greater part of the Spanish books which Ι have consulted3 and,
as many of them were printed early in the sixteenth century,
and are become extremely rare, the collecting of these was
such an occupation as alone required much time and assiduity.
To his friendly attention Ι am indebted for copies of several
valuable MSS. containing facts and details, which I might
have searched for in vain in worlrs that have been made
public! The Dcan was presented by the Infant Don Gabriel
of Spain with a Spanish translation of Sallust made and
published by the prince.

in 1808 he communicated to the Society of Antiquaries an
interesting description of the font in South Kilvington Church
(see Archaeologia‚ vol. xvi. p. 341), and in 1810, ‘An His·
torical and Descriptive Account of Ripon Miuster,’ in a paper
read before the society on March 15 and 22. This is printed in
the Archaeologia, vol. xvii, and a reprint, revised and corrected,
was issued at Ripon in 1827. On January 27, 1825, he com·
municated to the society a drawing of the capital of the Min-
strels' Pillar in the church of St. Mary at· Beverley, engraved .
in Archaeologia, vol. xxi. p. 553. Hc also wrote some remarks
on the picturas in the King of Spain’s collection, which
formerly belonged to Charles I. of England3 and he translated
Mengs' essay on painting.

The Dcan was an active, upright magistrate, and was also
very zealous in the promotion of public and private charity.
He was especially unremitting in his endeavours to forwurd
the prosperity of the Society for the Relicf of the North
Riding Olergy, of which he was president. As archdeacon oi
the East Riding he was patron of Mapleton, and gave to it a
benefaction of 1001. in 1811, and another 01 2001. in 1822 to
meet grants from the Governors of Queen’s Anne’s Bounty of
3001. on each occasion for the augmentation of that benefice.
He also gave 1001. in 1809, 2001. in 1811, and 2001. in 1827„
to meet similar grants in augmentation of the perpetual
curacy of Patelcy Bridge.

He married April 3, 1781, Anne Hope, daughter of Sir
Ludovick Graut of Grant, Bart. she died May 21, 1797,
aged fifty, leaving issue. The Dean survived until 1828, and
both were buried in Ripon Minstcr, where there are tablets to
their memory. On the Dean’s is the following inscription:
‘In memory of the Very Rev. Robert Darley Waddilove, Dein
of Ripon, and Archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire.
