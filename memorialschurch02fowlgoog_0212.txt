tion, allowing him to be beneficed. It is stated in the docu-
ment that Scropc was 01 0 noble family, and sixteen years 01
age. On March 12 following hc was presented by the King to
the stall 01 N unwick at Ripon, and on the following day was
instituted to the rectory 01 Catton, at the presentation 01 John
Dulce 01 Bedford. The death 01 Adam Fenrother vacated both
pieees of prcfcrment. (Reg. Bowct, ii. 26-27, where, however,
the prebend is said to be Sharow.) On October 23, 1431,
he was collated to the stall of Asgarby at Lineoln (Le N eve, vol.
ii. p. 102), which he erchanged on August 31, 1437, with
William Adam, 101 the living 01 Middlcton Chenduit (MSS.
Harl. 6952, 75 α). On June 22, 1448, Scrope erchanged
his 01011 01 Langstow 01 81011 Longa at Lineoln with Henry
Hanslape for the prebend of Skipwith at Howden and the

1421, hc was instituted attho presentation 01 Margery Lady
Scrope 01 Masham to the free chapel 01 West Witton (Μ88.

30, 1452, he was instituted to the rectory 01 Goldsbrough, which
he held till he died. (Reg. Archid. Richmond. 22 b, 43 a.)
In 1457 hc resigned the mastership 01 81. Leonard's Hospital,
York. (11188. Cotton, Vesp. F. xiii. 36.) The wish to
suppress the honours that were paid to Archbishop 8010ρο would
destroy William Scrope's chance 01 holding preferment in York
Minstcr. He is mentioned in the will 01 his brother, John Lord
Scrope, in 1453. (Test. Ebor. vol. ii. p. 190.) Ηο was buricd
